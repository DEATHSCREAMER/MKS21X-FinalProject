--------------------------------
Alvi : Created the Player class and made basic methods and properties like lives and ship avatar.
       Created basic bare-bone functions for main SpaceSanta.java
Tanzim: Read Mr.K's library and the java docs of lanterna. Made recquried abstract classes


January 8th, 2019
--------------------------------
Alvi : Had player.java implement CharSequence so it's compatible with Strings, etc. and made a "score" variable
       Had SpaceSanta.java use player.java and included lives and score the terminal window when running SpaceSanta
Tanzim:Made changes to SpaceSanta.java to allow it to compile and run monster classes. Finished the basics of monster class octopus. It is too late to commit now, so I wil make a commit when I wake yp


January 9th, 2019
------------------------------
Tanzim: made terminal demo to visualize the movement of the objects
Still no clue to make the monster move in a different way than the player


January 10th, 2019
------------------------------
Tanzim: I found a good youtube video explaining lanterna. Helped to make sense of the terminal methods.May be can implement lanterna.screen. Found the bug that the player behaves differently when it reaches the end of the screen.
Alvi: Was working on bullet, couldn't get multiple bullets to move in terminal after it was fired, no matter what I did


January 11th, 2019
------------------------------------
Tanzim:False alarm. It seems the player behaves differently only in windows. No need to fix anything there.Wrote most of the methods for the octopus class
Alvi: After browsing coding forums for java help of other people with similar problems, came upon the answer of a LIST of bullets


January 12, 2019
------------------------------
Tanzim:Made the octopus move differently. Still not ideal though.


January 13, 2019
------------------------------
Alvi: Made monsterbullets, octopi now fire monsterbullets and randomly spawn in. Player bullets
      now kill octopi and monsterbullets kill the player. Terminal exits when player dies and score goes up when monster dies.

January 16-19, 2019
------------------------------
Alvi: Crabs now exist, fire different bullets, and stun feature works (CHANGES PLAYER COLOR :O), no bugs so far.
      Animation for enemies implemented although they look a bit buggy so if monster movement speed doesn't changes
      then animation will be removed.
